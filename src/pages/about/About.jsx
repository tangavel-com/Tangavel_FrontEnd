                <p>
                    Tangavel was founded to carry forward the legacy of Thangavel Thevar, a respected trader and the grandfather of the founder, Kumaravel.
                    Inspired by his dedication and entrepreneurial spirit, Tangavel was established to take his vision beyond borders.
                    Rooted in tradition and driven by pride in our heritage, Tangavel represents the next chapter of a timeless legacyâ€”taking ancestral craftsmanship to the world.
